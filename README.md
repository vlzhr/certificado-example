# Certificado "QuickStart" Example

This is a prototype for Certificado.one. The application is used to store certificates data into a [Waves blockchain](https://wavesprotocol.org).

## How to run

You can just download the folder and run index.html file. 

If you want to change source code and built the app you will need to install Signer library.

`
npm i @waves/signer @waves.exchange/provider-web
`

Then use webpack to build an app.

`
webpack
`
 
## How to use

Create an account on [Waves Exchange Testnet](https://testnet.waves.exchange) and top up its balance using [Faucet](https://wavesexplorer.com/testnet/faucet).
